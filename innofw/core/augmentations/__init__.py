"""
This package is part of our framework's CORE, which is meant to give flexible support for different augmentation
libraries and frameworks via common abstract wrapper, currently it has support for:
- albumentations
- torchvision

Augmentations are techniques used to increase the amount of data by adding slightly modified copies of already existing
data or newly created synthetic data from existing data. It acts as a regularizer and helps reduce overfitting when
training a machine learning model.
Augmentations can be used not only in the training stage, but in the testing as well. In that case it is called test time
augmentation.
